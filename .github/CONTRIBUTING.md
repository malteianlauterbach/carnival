# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, create a Pull Request and your changes will be reviewed by helpers or moderators.

If you are a helper and are contributing code, please make a Pull Request unless the change is obvious and uncontroversial.

## Pull Request Process

1. Make sure your code works
2. Create a detailed description of your changes
3. You may merge the Pull Request once two other helpers or one moderator has reviewed your change, or if you 
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the moderator or second helper to merge it for you.
